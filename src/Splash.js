        We need to do what we can to #FlattenTheCurve, including complying with public restrictions on non-essential activities.  But as we know, pandemic mitigation measures hit some people harder than others. As of March 14, 18 percent of American adults report being laid off or having their hours cut (https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2020-03-17/coronavirus-layoffs-work-hours-jobs). Other workers are unable to work from home, either because their jobs require being physically present or because their employers do not provide paid leave.  These workers are at risk of contracting COVID-19 and incurring significant medical bills.</p>
        <p>Communities are coming together to support each other during these difficult times. This list is a compilation of funds that have been set up to support groups or sectors likely to suffer significant financial consequences because of the COVID-19 pandemic and its necessary mitigation measures. If you have extra income right now (maybe from coffees you're not buying, bars you're not visitng, concerts and festivals you're not attending), consider putting some of it toward supporting some of these funds.</p>
        <p className="emphasis">NOTE: This is a crowd-sourced list. The compilers are not affiliated with any of the funds, do not benefit from any of them, and have not personally vetted them. Please continue to use your own judgment and critical thinking skills. If you would like to add a fund or you have information that any of these funds are fraudulent or have ceased to exist, please contact us at covid19aidfunds [at] gmail [dot] com.</p>
